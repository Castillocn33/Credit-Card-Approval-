In this project, I demonstrated core skills of the data science workflow - data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, modeling, and model interpretation. 
I cleaned the data by handling missing values and converting data types to enable effective analysis. My exploratory analysis using visualizations provided insights into data distributions and relationships.
I engineered new features like BMI to improve model performance. Building regression models like linear models, lasso, and random forest allowed me to predict life expectancy. 
I used techniques like cross-validation to properly evaluate models. Finally, extracting feature importances from random forest provided actionable insights on important predictors.
Overall, by systematically applying this end-to-end workflow - from cleaning to visualization, feature engineering, modeling and interpreting - I honed my ability to reliably generate value from data. 
This project showcased my proficiency in key data science competencies.
